# Gen4PokemonPatcher

### Gen 4 Pokemon Patcher
* A patcher to modify the Generation 4 Pokémon games to run in 60FPS and to have modified shiny odds

### Setup to get this patcher working
* Have one of the following ROMs
  * Pokémon Diamond (USA) (Rev 5) (md5 of **02a1af2a677d101394b1d99164a8c249**)
  * Pokémon Pearl (USA) (Rev 5) (md5 of **e5da92c8cfabedd0d037ff33a2f2b6ba**)
  * Pokémon Platinum (USA) (Rev 1) (md5 of **ab828b0d13f09469a71460a34d0de51b**)
  * Pokémon HeartGold (USA) (md5 of **258cea3a62ac0d6eb04b5a0fd764d788**)
  * Pokémon SoulSilver (USA) (md5 of **8a6c8888bed9e1dce952f840351b73f2**)
* Navigate to the game you'd like to patch and select the ROM
* Please be patient when your ROM is being patched. It'll look like nothing is happening, but wait for the confirmation that it's done
* Have fun playing the Gen 4 Pokémon games in 60FPS or with boosted shiny odds!

### Note if planning to use the randomizer
* **Patch your ROM first with this before using the randomizer**
* The randomizer will shuffle bytes around, and I'm not sure if it'll work after the randomizer modifies the ROM, so to be on the safe side just use this first
  * This will have your ROM come up as unsupported, but that's because it no longer matches a known hash. Everything should still randomize properly regardless of that
